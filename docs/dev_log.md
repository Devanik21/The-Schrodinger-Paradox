- Reviewed theoretical foundations to ensure consistency between optimization objectives and the intended inductive biases.
- Revisited earlier design decisions to distinguish fundamental constraints from incidental implementation choices.
- Audited internal data flow to minimize unintended information leakage across abstraction layers.
- Aligned terminology across modules to maintain conceptual consistency throughout the system.
- Revisited earlier design decisions to distinguish fundamental constraints from incidental implementation choices.
- Translated informal reasoning into clearer invariants to support more rigorous future analysis.
- Documented trade-offs between model expressivity and stability, noting regimes where each becomes limiting.
- Revisited earlier design decisions to distinguish fundamental constraints from incidental implementation choices.
- Re-examined architectural choices in response to observed failure modes; identified sources of hidden coupling that may constrain extensibility.
- Revisited earlier design decisions to distinguish fundamental constraints from incidental implementation choices.
- Explicitly documented known limitations and conditions under which the current approach is expected to fail.
