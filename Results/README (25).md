## 🧬 Research Philosophy

> **Systems-Theoretic Approach**

My work focuses on designing high-reliability cognitive architectures and mathematically grounded self-organizing systems.

This portfolio represents a rigorous engineering effort in **distributed state estimation**, **control-theoretic stability**, and **scalable neuro-symbolic integration**. Each project targets specific bottlenecks in current AI systems—memory consolidation, causal reasoning, and energetic efficiency.

**Engineering Methodology:**
1.  **Metric-Driven Development** - Quantifying internal state dynamics via information geometry.
2.  **Scalability First** - Designing architectures that survive orders-of-magnitude scaling.
3.  **Reproducible Emergence** - Rigorous benchmarking of emergent behaviors under adversarial conditions.
4.  **Mathematical Grounding** - Leveraging information theory (entropy, mutual information) as the primary optimization objective.
